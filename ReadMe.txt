Clustering:
-----------
. Implemented hierarchy clustering algorithms (single-linkage/complete-linkage/
	average-linkage) and point assignment clustering algorithm (Lloyd’s and K-mean++) with Python.
.	Applied these algorithms to cluster IRIS and other data set from UCI, calculated
	hamming distance. Analyzed and compared their accuracy and performance.
. For detail, please refer to Clustering/Clustering.pptx

DecisionTree:
-----------
. Implemented Decision Tree ID3 with Python. Pruned the tree to avoid overfitting. 
	Applied random forest to improve the accuracy.
. Applied some data sets from UCI to train the decision tree and predict the 
	target label. The accuracy is up to 90% for some well-balanced dataset.
